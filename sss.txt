hi i'm rebecca from engvid in this

special lesson i'm going to show you how

to plan your english learning so that

you can get the best results based on

your needs and in order to identify your

needs we're gonna go through a series of

questions okay now these are the same

questions that I use with my consulting

clients from all over the world to help

to find the best path for them to

achieve their goals and I believe if you

follow these steps you will be able to

do the same thing so what you might want

to do is to grab a piece of paper and as

we go through the questions make some

notes for yourself okay and then by the

end of the lesson you may actually have

a much clearer idea of what the next

step in order to achieve your English

learning goals okay and also what are

the best strategies that you can use to

get there okay so are you ready let's

get started

okay so the first question that you need

to ask yourself is why are you learning

English now I know that sounds pretty

obvious like why okay well I need to I

have to these are some of the things I

hear up front then when we go a little

bit further we start to get more real

reasons and why is that important why is

the why of our life important because

the why is the motivation then why is

your fuel to reach to help you take this

journey okay

learning English is a journey and you

need that motivation and you need to

know clearly why am i doing all this and

so in order to do that first somebody

might say to me well I'm learning

English for my job and I say okay why

are you learning English for your job to

get a better job why are you trying to

get a better job to earn more money why

are you trying to earn more money

because I have to provide for my family

why do you have to provide for your

family because I love them they're the

most important thing in the world with

that

me okay now we found the real reason it

wasn't just that you were learning

English for your job you're learning

English fear for your family who you

love with all your heart so like in

everything there's a rational reason why

we do something and there's an emotional

reason if you can find your emotional

reason then along with your rational

reason now you have really strong

motivation so ask yourself these

questions okay because nobody has to do

anything we choose to do something find

your way and you will have the strongest

motivation to achieve your goals okay so

now more specifically let's look at some

of the whys that people have usually so

number one university let's suppose

you're trying to get into university why

is it important to know that because the

Y is also going to determine the what

what you need to study so what's your

why is it to get into university if so

then you need to focus on academic

English alright and that's actually an

entire field off English language

learning

it's called English for academic

purposes then you need to get those kind

of books attend those kind of courses

work with teachers who have experience

in those areas

alright why because your needs are very

specific right your needs are to be able

to write papers and assignments at a

university level to understand lectures

to read textbooks with lots of technical

vocabulary right so that's why focusing

in on your why to get into university

will help you to determine your what

alright there are many more questions

let's suppose your why is an exam you

need to pass an exam then let's suppose

it's the IELTS or the TOEFL or the toy

or the Pte then your study strategy is

completely different right from somebody

else because these exams are like a

world in themselves you need to

understand the exam you need to know

reading writing listening speaking but

not just in general

but for that exam you need to know how

to do well there and you need to find a

teacher or a training program which

prepares you for the exam which is very

different from just general English

learning okay

and that's another area where you will

need specialized training okay next if

it is for your job or your career then

you're probably talking about business

English but again within the world of B

E which is business English there are so

many different needs and so many

different areas what are your needs if

it's for your job or career what do you

actually need to be able to do better

than you do today do you need to write

email more effectively and correctly do

you need to give strong presentations do

you need to entertain clients or talk to

them on the telephone by identifying

exactly what you need to do at work you

will then focus on that particular skill

okay because what happens when people

get confused about learning English or

when they get stuck in a particular area

it's because they lose focus okay they

think they have to just keep doing a lot

of English a lot of grammar a lot of

vocabulary no it's not just that in the

beginning it's some of that but

afterwards it gets focused to a specific

goal like I want to be able to write a

not an excellent a perfect email but an

excellent email as far as I'm concerned

okay or I need to make sure that I can

give that presentation and really nail

it so when you identify that

presentation English is very specific

there are books which are just about how

to do well in presentations there are

teachers and trainers who will work with

you to optimize your presentations okay

such as myself I do that all the time I

work with diplomats I work with

executives I work with international

students who are preparing for their

their PhD or something like that okay

and various situations where that's a

very specific skill okay so by

identifying what your exact needs are

then you will be able to find the right

and design the right training program or

trainer for you ok let's go on let's

suppose your needs are more to become a

specialist of some kind then you need

something which is called actually

English for specific purposes and in

case you don't know there are actually

specific books English for engineers

English for nurses English for doctors

English for lawyers English for

journalists English for engineers all

kinds of detailed professions have their

own textbooks and you may be able to

find a trainer who has actually

specialized in this area so that's

something else to keep in mind alright

so identify if your profession is

something specific and check out if

there are materials specifically for

that you might be surprised

I myself have written specialized

materials for various courses that I've

run English for accountants English for

economists English for production

engineers and things like that ok so

check that out and think about whether

what your real needs are next maybe it's

not about this maybe you're learning

English for social purposes or for

personal reasons you want to make more

friends you want to travel or for

cultural reasons you want to be able to

enjoy movies and songs and really

understand them and grow as a person and

enjoy more of English life then your

kind of English is going to be different

right the English that you need to focus

on a little bit more conversational more

general ok and also the resources that

you're going to use are going to be

quite different you might be listening

to music and songs and watching shows

and movies or listening to the news your

whole strategy will be completely

different ok now a couple of other

questions that you need to ask yourself

along this journey is when for example

what do I mean by that when do you need

to achieve a specific result when my

clients come to me they usually have

something that's urgent coming up let's

say in a mom

thorry two months or even next week

there might be a very important

presentation so we have to achieve

something in a short period of time so

do you have a short deadline do you need

to appear for an exam very soon or do

you have a longer deadline okay so think

about that is it something you must do

urgently

or do you have time and also what kind

of time do you have available to devote

to this goal okay do you have are you

able to work on it full-time are you a

younger person who can spend a lot of

time on it or are you a working person

you can only work on your English

part-time you can only work on it on the

weekends or only in the evenings or only

15 minutes a day whatever it is identify

that answer for you okay it will help

you to design a program that you can

stick with because the point is if you

design a plan very ambitiously but then

you can't stick to it it's not going to

help you okay so design something

realistic taking into account your daily

schedule and your reality and your life

okay

now the other point is where where do

you want to study English okay are you

looking to study locally okay are you

trying to go overseas and go to a

language school abroad and in Canada or

the States or in England or Australia or

are you ready to study online this is

how I do most of my training right I

work with people on skype and so on and

that way it doesn't matter where in the

world people are of course today people

are working online with all kinds of

trainers so that's another big option

that's opened up to you the whole world

is opened up to you so you could find a

trainer online or a program online so

this is another point that I want you to

make in case you're making notes is

where is it possible for you to study

can you leave your country do you need

to leave your country is it the best

option think about it okay and next

we're going to look at a few more

questions that are going to help you to

zero in on what you really need Oh

so let's look at the next question which

is how much which means how much money

how much money do you have available for

this purpose of improving your English

are you going to go with the free option

okay where you perhaps do not really

have a budget for that but you still

want to improve or are you gonna be

looking at some paid options or of

course you can always look at a

combination of those all right so let's

see how your budget affects some of your

options all right so that we come to the

how so are you going to study for

example by yourself kind of you know

with the free option in a group or a

school or with a private teacher or

trainer these are some of the main

options that people choose so what are

some of the things you can do alone you

can do a lot alone especially today

right you know that you're watching me

right now you're watching you're

watching RIT and you watch all our

teachers so you know that you can do a

lot of English language learning online

so of course you can go online watching

videos you can listen to music you can

watch your favorite TV shows can watch

movies you can play games you can

download apps you can read books and

from each of these you can learn

something different okay from the news

there's so much so much that in

vocabulary you can pick up you can learn

about accent you can learn how to speak

well from the music you can go and look

at the lyrics of a particular song that

you love and that's a great fun way to

improve your English by singing okay do

you know that music has a special

quality because of the music and the

words you're actually using both parts

of your brain and you can learn really

easily so learning the words of a song

and singing it in English or wonderful

way to improve your English and also

sometimes your grammar depending on what

you're listening to okay and your accent

as well and all of these have ways in

which you can mind that for whatever you

need for vocabulary for expressions when

you're watching something

sit down with your notebook right write

down the words write down the

expressions that your favorite actor is

saying write down a phrase in a song

that you want to try to use yourself

something that appeals to your heart is

something that you're going to use and

it's a great way to learn okay there are

a couple of things to keep in mind these

methods and learning by yourself will

help you with reading and listening

improve your vocabulary improve your

grammar but when you're talking about

the productive skills where you have to

produce the language which are speaking

and writing there it's really very tough

to improve by yourself why because you

need someone to talk to

you need to practice what actually

happens when you need to speak and for

writing you need someone to evaluate

your writing and give you feedback okay

because if you keep writing every day

you might be making the same mistakes

and that's a shame and that's a kind of

a waste of time and time is also money

all right so keep that in mind and now

let's look at what happens then when we

go to some of the paid options so one

option is to join a group or a school a

language school all right there are all

kinds of language schools I'm sure where

you live as well as all over the world

which specialize in ESL students and

let's look at what the options are

between and some of the differences are

between going with this school option or

going with a private teacher or trainer

what will happen in the school generally

speaking not always but generally

schools cost less per hour

so they cost less money you're going to

make general progress because you're

part of a group and depending on the

school there might be four people in

your class or there might be 14 people

in your class or 24 people in your class

okay it depends on the time of year

depends on the school lots of things so

you will make progress but it's more

general progress and it usually takes

more time because of that all right

you're not going to get as much time in

a speaking class your writing is not

going to

as much feedback your all of your skills

okay are not gonna get you are not gonna

get as much attention on the other hand

if you decide to work with a private

teacher or a trainer

generally speaking per hour it costs

more money that doesn't mean overall

it's gonna cost more money but per hour

it's going to look like it costs more

money but what is the advantage or with

a private teacher you're gonna make very

specific progress okay so for example in

your speaking if you have an accent

issue well that's difficult to handle

right in a class teacher can give you

that kind of attention or if you're

trying to do some pass a particular exam

maybe you're in the course maybe you're

in the IELTS course or the TOEFL course

but you keep having a problem with the

writing and the teacher can help you in

that context so maybe you'll do a

combination of this you will take the

school classes or the exam prep classes

in general but maybe for writing for a

short while you'll do a combination and

you'll have a private teacher who's

working with you specifically on your

writing or on your speaking or whatever

your challenge is okay and also because

with a private teacher you are the only

student you're going to get it's gonna

take you're going to achieve your goals

faster it's gonna take less time okay

because you get all the attention and

therefore you get a lot more value out

of it out of that experience out of that

money out of that investment of time and

money so don't always write off the

private treat your trainer because if

you're facing a particular talent that

teacher or trainer could be an answer to

your prayers okay so these are some of

the basic elements and basic differences

between this group in school and the

private teacher and the solo options now

in real life you're probably doing a

combination of these things at different

times and that's perfectly fine

it'll keep changing based on whatever

you need or wherever you're at it also

depends where you are today in terms of

your level if you're a beginner or

intermediate you're probably going to

start here

and if you are at a higher level or if

you're facing a particular Talent

you may go to that other option okay

also with the paid option remember

sometimes it's coming out of your pocket

and if you work in an organization they

may have a training budget which you

have access to so check that out check

with your company whether they have a

budget to help you with your English

language learning I've worked with lots

and lots of corporations and I know for

sure that they do and hopefully your

company does as well so I hope that each

of these questions has helped you get a

better understanding of what exactly you

need and what's the best plan for you to

follow to achieve your goals remember

we've looked at the why what where when

how much how and with whom and each of

these questions in each of your answers

has hopefully taken you one step closer

to the best solution for your situation

and your reality okay now if you found
